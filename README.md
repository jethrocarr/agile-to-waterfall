agile-to-waterfall
==================

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'agile' with 'waterfall'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/jethrocarr/agile-to-waterfall/raw/master/AgiletoWaterfall.crx)

Copied entirely from the hard work of @panicsteve and shamelessly sed'd.


Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag AgileToWaterfall.crx into the page that appears.

I was going to add support for other browsers, but that ticket is in the backlog still.


Building
--------

To build yourself, see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging
